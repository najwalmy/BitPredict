## Introduction 🌟

In this project, I explore cryptocurrency price prediction using the CoinGecko API and machine learning – the ability to learn patterns from data and make informed predictions. By leveraging the CoinGecko API, I fetch historical and current crypto market data, which serves as the foundation for the machine learning model. Trained on this data, the model predicts future cryptocurrency prices, providing valuable insights for investment strategies and market trend analysis.

## Features ✨

- 🗂️ Fetch historical and current cryptocurrency market data from the CoinGecko API.
- 🤖 Train a machine learning model on the fetched data.
- 📊 Predict future cryptocurrency prices based on the trained model.
- 💡 Provide insights for investment strategies and market trend analysis.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BitPredict.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd BitPredict
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 📚

1. Fetch the cryptocurrency market data from CoinGecko API:
    ```bash
    python fetch_data.py
    ```
2. Train the machine learning model on the fetched data:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
3. Predict future cryptocurrency prices:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```
